   I compiled from a variety of sources the numbers of American casualties
      by quarter in major United States conflicts since World War II.  The effort
      was undertaken as part of another project, but I found this graphic
      interesting enough to post on its own.  Of note for me are the amazing number
      of fatalities suffered in Korea and Vietnam when compared to Operation Iraqi
      Freedom today.

   The holes from 1980 forward are not necessarily indicative of zero
      fatality counts, but rather the data on the web for non-major conflicts
      are less available.  Excellent records of Vietnam and Korean fatalities can
      be found at the
   <a href="http://aad.archives.gov/aad/" target="_blank">
    National Archives
   </a>
   ,
      and the
   <a href="http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/castop.htm" target="_blank">
    Department of Defense
   </a>
   has good records for post-2000
      conflicts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: Data updated in February, 2013 to include fatalities through quarter 4, 2012
   from
