    <h1 id="crisis-of-accountability">Crisis of accountability</h1>

<p>America has a crisis of presidential accountability. The president’s accountability to Congress and to the electorate are insufficient to the powers granted to the modern executive branch.</p>

<p>The crisis, in my view, has two causes. First, Congress has incrementally yielded its powers to the executive over the previous 80 years, lessening its ability to hold the executive to account. Second, the two major political parties have polarized in their policy positions. The two parties are now much more homogenous and divergent in how they envision federal policy. This polarization makes the difference in actions taken by a Democratic versus a Republican president more dramatic than they used to be.</p>

<p>With Congress less willing to check the executive and the party of the president of incredible importance to the direction of federal government policy, the <strong>stakes of quadrennial presidential elections have surged</strong>. The stakes are perceived as so great that some supporters of each party now speak in eschatological terms – if our candidate does not win, this is the end of America as we know it.</p>

<p>This is our crisis.</p>

<p>The quadrennial presidential election cannot be the only basis of presidential accountability. With polarized parties, voters are left with too stark a choice, and the binary vote, filtered through the Electoral College, is too blunt an instrument to allow the voters to serve as a complete check on the actions of the president.</p>

<p>James Madison famously wrote in <em>Federalist 51</em>, ``A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.’’ The Framers built <em>auxiliarly precautions</em> into the institutions of the 1787 Constitution: the checks and balances of the federal government’s separated powers. Power would be checked because the branches had to work together to get things done.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the polarization of the parties and the high stakes of each presidential election have made copartisan Members of Congress less interested, if not unwilling, to check the president. Because the stakes are so high and the parties so competitive, congresspeople worry that any dent they make in their copartisan candidate might lead to a loss.</p>

<p>High stakes also make actions taken by the other party to hold the president accountable of ambiguous legitimacy. Voters do not know if the out-party is investigating the president because of actual malfeasance, or as a fishing expedition to dig up political dirt.</p>

<h1 id="responses-to-the-crisis-of-accountability">Responses to the crisis of accountability</h1>

<p>These two factors and the corresponding crisis of accountability have led students of the presidency to ponder reforms. Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith have <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfares-publishing-book-bob-bauer-and-jack-goldsmiths-after-trump">a new book</a> arguing for a platform of statutory and administrative policy reforms to rein in the executive and increase accountability to Congress. Their response to the crisis of accountability is to increase congressional checks on the executive.</p>

<p>Will Howell and Terry Moe, in contrast, have <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo58173644.html">a new book</a> arguing for giving more power to the president. Their response to the crisis of accountability is to increase the power of the executive to clarify their actions and responsibilities for voters.</p>

<p>These books, in other words, offer opposite recommendations to increase accountability of the president and the executive branch. The Bauer Goldsmith book suggests we increase presidential accountability to Congress. The Howell Moe book suggests we increase presidential accountability to the electorate.</p>

<p>Neither solution, however, seems to me to get at the heart of the problem. The heart of the problem is that party politics muddy accountability of the executive for both congress and the electorate.</p>

<p>Because modern American politics is polarized, which party controls the presidency has considerable importance for national policy. Because modern American politics is highly competitive, with both sides able to imagine they can win the next election, any action to dent the standing of a copartisan president is risky.</p>

<p>Thus, whether you are a member of Congress or a member of the electorate, taking action to hold a copartisan president to account means taking a risk of losing the next election. Checking an executive with whom you agree on policy means trading off risks to policy representation for accountability. In 2020, it seems few voters and few members of Congress are willing to make much of a trade of policy for accountability. This calls into question the effectiveness of proposals from each book.</p>

<h1 id="an-alternative-reform">An alternative reform</h1>

<p>If polarized parties and reluctant Congress are the heart of the crisis, how can we reform institutions to create a mechanism of accountability?</p>

<p>Here is an idea: Elect the executive out of the House of Representatives. This was one of the proposals at the constitutional convention in 1787. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan">New Jersey plan</a> proposed that the executive be elected directly by the Congress. This is a system similar to the Westminister model used in the United Kingdom, though without members of the legislature populating the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Granting the House the power to elect the president might be a path to executive accountability consistent with our modern polarized and competitive party politics.</p>

<p>Electing the president from the House allows for direct yet surgical accountability to Congress with less risk to policy goals. Under this system, the majority in the House elects the president and retains the power to replace the president. Crucially, the majority can replace the president with an alternative individual who need not be the nominee of the other major party with whom they strongly disagree on policy. They can elevate an  individual who is acceptable to the majority on policy.</p>

<p>Electing the president from the House increases accountability to the electorate because the House is up for election every two years, rather than every four. Allowing for 435 different outcomes also decreases the stakes of any single election. The House would provide some insulation from the incentives for divisiveness that come with a single national election.</p>

<p>Letting the House elect both the Speaker of the House and the President also expands the space of negotiation between different factions of interests. It might even facilitate more than two parties in Congress, where third parties could campaign on platforms for Speaker and President to check the polarized tendencies of the major parties.</p>

<p>Under the New Jersey plan, accountability does not depend upon statutory or administrative policy reforms as in the Bauer and Goldsmith book, which can be revised by the legislature, ignored by the executive, or struck down by the courts. Accountability does not depend on a presidential election every four years where voters’ option is to replace the malfeasant incumbent with a challenger of with starkly different policy views.</p>

<p>Clearly there are other considerations with respect to such a dramatic reform. The reform would require a constitutional amendment. However, it is worth pondering whether this amendment might lessen the current crisis of accountability by making the president directly accountable to the House and lessening the political stakes of a single qudrennial election in a setting with polarized parties.</p>
